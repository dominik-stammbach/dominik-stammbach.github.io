### About me

I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP)](https://citp.princeton.edu/citp-people/dominik-stammbach/) and the [Polaris Lab](https://www.polarislab.org/) at Princeton University. I received my Dr. Sc. in Spring 2024 from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) for my dissertation on on data-centric automated fact-checking.

My current research centers on legal NLP and AI to support public defenders and improve access to justice. We are developing AI tools to provide computational assistance for public defenders and make their work more effective. In parallel, we are conducting interviews with public defenders across the US to understand their perspectives on AI. Our goal is to identify opportunities and challenges around AI and its implications on the day-to-day work of public defenders, and especially what would be good use cases to develop AI tools for.

More broadly, my research aims to develop NLP and AI that serve public agencies and strengthen the public sector.
