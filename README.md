### About me

I am a postdoctoral research associate at [CITP](https://citp.princeton.edu/citp-people/dominik-stammbach/) and the [Polaris Lab](https://www.polarislab.org/) at Princeton University. I am currently working on legal NLP and AI which works for public defenders. Prior to that, I obtained my Dr. Sc. in Spring 2024 at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) for my thesis on data-centric automated fact checking.

My research interests are in applied NLP. Currently I work mostly on legal NLP and legal search for public defenders. More broadly, I'm interested in opportunities and challenges of NLP and AI for public agencies and public service overall, and what role NLP and AI can play to make public service more effective.

### Current Projects

- Legal search for public defenders
- [Qualitative interview study](https://coda.io/@inyoungcheong/ai-for-public-defense) on What kind of AI / computational assistance public defenders need
