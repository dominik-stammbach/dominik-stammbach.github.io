### About me

I am a Ph.D. student in Natural Language Processing at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). My research interests are applied natural language processing. Some projects of mine are concerned with the interesection of NLP and Climate Change, especially greenwashing detection. I also work on online safety, especially misinformation detection, and computational social sciences and computational narrative analysis. I am excited to work on interdisciplinary projects using a text as data approach.

My Ph.D. supervisors are Elliott Ash and Mrinmaya Sachan. See my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/srm23lq2bgyfuw8hoxm9q/cv.pdf?rlkey=d8ox1ea78gx0ydn18mnck69hr&dl=0) for more information.
